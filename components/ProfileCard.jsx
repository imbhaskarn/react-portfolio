        Hello! My name is Bhaskar and I enjoy creating things that live on the
        internet. My interest in web development started back in 2017 when my
        freind asked me to build a lottery website. After so many efforts I was
        able to build a working website with php, Html, css. I also put this
        website on a domain that I bought from google. Fast-forward to today,
        and Iâ€™ve had the privilege of working with great engineers in the
        industry, a fintech start-up, and an early stage startup. My main focus
        these days is building accessible, inclusive products and digital
        experiences at EventRio. I am also taking a deep dive in cloud and
        design patterns.
